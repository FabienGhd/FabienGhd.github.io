    <h2 class="titleAbout">About Me...</h2>

    <div id="about">
        <p class="firstLine">Hi there! 👋 My name is Fabien, and I'm a first-year graduate student studying cybersecurity at the
            <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/en/welcome-universite-de-rennes-1" target="_blank">University of Rennes</a>.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What I like most about writing code is that it combines a lot of different aspects of my personality. I like rational thoughts but on the other side I also really enjoy the collaborative and creative mindset we can have when building something from scratch.
            As a curious student, my main areas of interest lie in CS theory and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p> What draws me to cybersecurity is the opportunity to make a positive impact by protecting people's digital assets and privacy.
            It's a field that requires both technical expertise and critical thinking skills, and I find the challenge of identifying and mitigating potential cyber threats extremely rewarding. 
            Whether it's through implementing stronger security measures or educating others about safe online practices, I believe that cybersecurity has the power to make a significant difference in today's interconnected world.
