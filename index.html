    <h2 class="titleAbout">About Me...</h2>

    <div id="about">
        <p class="firstLine">Hi there! 👋 My name is Fabien, and I'm an incoming third-year Computer Science student at the 
            <a href="https://www.univ-rennes1.fr/en/welcome-universite-de-rennes-1" target="_blank">University of Rennes</a>
            (Bachelor's degree focusing on Software Engineering for now).
        </p>
        
        <p>
            What I like most about writing code is that it combines a lot of different aspects of my personality. I like rational thoughts but on the other side I also really enjoy the collaborative and creative mindset we can have when building something from scratch.
            As a curious student, my main areas of interest lie in CS theory and cybersecurity.
        </p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy learning new languages, reading self growth books, going on runs and playing tennis with my friends.
            I've had a great interest in traveling ever since I was a child. Through the different trips in different
            geographic areas, I can assure the idea that travel makes you a more open-minded person is deeply rooted in
            my mind.
            Thus, I am naturally always willing to experience different cultures and embrace new perspectives.
        </p>
